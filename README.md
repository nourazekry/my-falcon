# Falcon Speaker Diarization

Website that takes any audio and determines exactly "who spoke when"!

## AccessKey

Falcon requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Falcon SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Install & run

Use `yarn` or `npm` to install the dependencies, and the `start` script to start a local web server hosting the demo.

```console
yarn
yarn start
```

(or)

```console
npm install
npm run start
```

Open `localhost:5000` in your web browser, as hinted at in the output:

```console
Available on:
  http://localhost:5000
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Wait until Falcon and the WebVoiceProcessor have initialized. Choose an audio file or record audio to diarize.
